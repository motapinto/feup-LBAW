## Project Description

Keyshare is an online global marketplace which specializes in the sale of gaming related digital products using redemption keys.

Keyshare is divided into two major parts:

* User side - Where we can buy, sell, review and report videogame keys
* Admin side - Where all information on the website can be updated / deleted but also insert new information

Keyshare was develped using Laravel framework using Bootstrap 4 as front-end design library and a Postgres Database architecture using PGAdmin as GUI interface with the database.
