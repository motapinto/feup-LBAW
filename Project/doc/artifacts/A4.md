# A4: Conceptual Data Model

The project consists in developing a global marketplace which specializes in the sale of gaming related digital products using redemption keys.

In the fourth artefact, the focus was designing the UML diagram for the relational database. By the end of this iteration, we were able:

* Gain a clear vision of what the relational model will be.
* Clarify new Business Rules and refine the ones already especified in Artifact 3.

## 2. Additional Business Rules
 
#### Note: The majority of new business rules are included in the UML, here we list those that because of graphical organization of the UML diagram were not included there

| Business Rule ID | Description | 
| -------- | -------- | 
| BR01     | When an admin wants to delete a product, if at least one user has already bought a key for that product, the product is not deleted and instead is moved to the class **deleted product**|
###### Table1: Additional Business Rules
