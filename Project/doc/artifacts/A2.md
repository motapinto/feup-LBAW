###### Table 11: Technical Requirements 

The most important technical requirements for this project are:
* **Security** - Since all products sold on the website are redemption keys a security failure will potentially lead to a catastrophic loss of revenue and costumer trust.
* **Robustness** - It is important for the website to be able to handle runtime errors, such as when 2 costumers try to buy the same offer at almost the same time so that they don't get the same key which can only be used once by only one of them. 
* **Usability** - The website should very simple and easy to use so customers can make purchase and sell products without any type of delay independently of the device they access it from.
