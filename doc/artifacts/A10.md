# A10: Presentation

> The goal of this artifact is to describe in brief detail the features developed and showcase the final product.

## 1. Product presentation
> The project consists of developing a global marketplace that specializes in the sale of gaming-related digital products using redemption keys.

[KeyShare](http://lbaw2043.lbaw-prod.fe.up.pt) is an online shop with two greater sections:

* The user side - Where we can browse and search for the products we want using filters and a text search feature, so that we buy and sell games, with the help of a shopping cart that is available even if the user is not logged in. After buying a key there is a possibility to review and report the seller.
* The admin side - Where we can add/edit/delete all the information about the products and their specifications. The administrator can also ban/unban users as well as delete reviews he might find offensive or abusive. He can also alter the FAQ's available questions.
